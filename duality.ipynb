To do this, we'll take the perspective of a person who is selling iron and calcium pills to the dieter. The pill-seller must decide how much to charge per pill. Each pill contains one unit of its respective nutrient. And, the pills must be priced competitively with respect to the five food types available to the dieter.\n",

Since the dieter would need 21 iron pills and 12 calcium pills to meet his nutritional requirements, the pill-seller stands to collect a revenue of $21 \\pi_i + 12 \\pi_c$ if he prices the pills fairly. We enforce fair pricing by writing a structural constraint for each of the 5 food types. For example, food type 3 is equivalent to 3 iron pills and 2 calcium pills, and is priced at 31 per ounce, so $3 \\pi_i + 2 \\pi_c \\le 31$."
